# Relational Algebra Parser

Code written by [tado-mi](https://github.com/tado-mi).

Following is an implementation of Recusrive Descent and a Table Driven parser for relation algebra expressions. It was written as a solution of an assignment for the course **CSC 173** at the University of Rochester. It is made public to demonstrate a code sample by the authors, and for learning. We trust it will not be used to violate academic honesty policies.

I wrote the code long after I took the class. Because I am a bored nerd, I was bored at a party once, and I wanted to learn how to use header files well.
